Goals:
	Get it working, bad output is better than no output
	Presentation - Background info, Test Results, Demo

Scrum meeting:
Slim:
	Outputting disparity looks wrong but will tweak with settings
	Error causing issues with disparity was from featuredetector/descriptormatcher
	SIFT/SURF aren't free so were excluded from prebuilt java libraries
	Virtualbox with Ubuntu installed, make/building libraries with extra content (opencv_contrib)
		Will get Tomcat working soon for "packaged product"
